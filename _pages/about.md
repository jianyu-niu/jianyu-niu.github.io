Short Bios
------
I am currently a research assistant professor at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech), working with [Prof. Yinqian Zhang](https://yinqian.org/). I received my Ph.D. degree from [The University of British Columbia](https://ok.ubc.ca/) (UBC) in Sep. 2021, under the supervision of [Prof. Chen Feng](https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/chen-feng/). My research fields include blockchain, distributed systems, TEE and computer networks. 


**Our research lab has multiple openings for Research Associate, Post-doctoral Researchers, Research/Software Engineers, Research Assistants, Research Interns. If you are interested in working with me or any directions of our lab, please drop me or Prof. Zhang an email for more information.**
